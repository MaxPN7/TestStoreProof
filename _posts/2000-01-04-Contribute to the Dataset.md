You can help us contributing to the Dataset !!

# Contribute to the dataset

If you want to provide your list of Youtube urls and contribute to the project, fork [this repo](https://github.com/imatge-upc/speech2signs/tree/dataset) and add your text file containing your list of urls directly in the dataset folder, then make a pull request.

To write this text file, you have to follow this convention:

* Put one url per line, nothing else
* Comments begins with '#' and put one comment per line, nothing else
* Blanks in the text files are ignored.

You can create your own folder inside the dataset folder (check the recursive option of the dldataset app).
You can take a look at the existing dataset [here](https://github.com/imatge-upc/speech2signs/tree/dataset)
